## Hello!
I'm Alex. A graduate with Bachelor of "Automation, information and control systems", with an interest in all things programming (Python, C, C++) as well as embedded systems and software.

My last project was designing and building a 3D printed, 4 Degree of freedom robotic arm controlled using a board based on the ATmega328P, running code written in C++ that performs inverse kinematic calculations for determining the positions of the separate joints.
